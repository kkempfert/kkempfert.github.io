Recently, the growing field of music information retrieval (MIR) has offered quantitative analyses to complement traditional qualitative analyses of these composers. In this MIR study, we classify the composer of Haydn and Mozart string quartets based on the content of their scores. Our contribution is an interpretable statistical and machine learning approach that provides high classification accuracies and musical relevance. We develop novel global features that are automatically computed from symbolic data and informed by musicological Haydn-Mozart comparative studies, particularly relating to the sonata form. Several of these proposed features are found to be important for distinguishing between Haydn and Mozart string quartets. Our Bayesian logistic regression model attains leave-one-out classification accuracies over 84%, higher than prior works and providing interpretations that could aid in assessing musicological claims. Overall, our work can help expand the longstanding dialogue surrounding Haydn and Mozart and exemplify the benefit of interpretable machine learning in MIR, with potential applications to music generation and classification of other classical composers.","tags":null,"title":"Where Does Haydn End and Mozart Begin?

Novel data streams, such as Internet and social media data, have recently been reported to benefit infectious disease prediction. As a case study of dengue in Brazil, we have combined multiple traditional and non-traditional, heterogeneous data streams (satellite imagery, Internet, weather, and clinical surveillance data) across its 27 states on a weekly basis over seven years. For each state, we nowcast dengue based on several time series models, which vary in complexity and inclusion of exogenous data. The top-performing model varies by state, motivating our consideration of ensemble approaches to automatically combine these models for better outcomes at the state level. Model comparisons suggest that predictions often improve with the addition of exogenous data, although similar performance can be attained by including only one exogenous data stream (either weather data or the novel satellite data) rather than combining all of them. Our results demonstrate that Brazil can be nowcasted at the state level with high accuracy and confidence, inform the utility of each individual data stream, and reveal potential geographic contributors to predictive performance. Our work can be extended to other spatial levels of Brazil, vector-borne diseases, and countries, so that the spread of infectious disease can be more effectively curbed.","tags":null,"title":"Time Series Methods and Ensemble Models to Nowcast Dengue at the State Level in Brazil","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Katherine Kempfert","Kaitlyn Martinez","Amir Siraj","Jessica Conrad","Geoffrey Fairchild","Amanda Ziemann","Nidhi Parikh","David Osthus","Nicholas Generous","Sara Del Valle","Carrie Manore"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1591142400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591142400,"objectID":"8f95e828f29a7b3a32dc1fd282fe05e8","permalink":"https://kkempfert.github.io/works/dengue/","publishdate":"2020-06-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/works/dengue/","section":"works","summary":"Predicting an infectious disease can help reduce its impact by advising public health interventions and personal preventive measures.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and their kernel variants (KPCA, KLDA) are among the most popular DR methods. Recently, Supervised Kernel Principal Component Analysis (SKPCA) has been shown as another successful alternative. In this paper, brief reviews of these popular techniques are presented first. We then conduct a comparative performance study based on three simulated datasets, after which the performance of the techniques are evaluated through application to a pattern recognition problem in face image analysis. The gender classification problem is considered on MORPH-II and FG-NET, two popular longitudinal face aging databases. Several feature extraction methods are used, including biologically-inspired features (BIF), local binary patterns (LBP), histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and the Active Appearance Model (AAM). After applications of DR methods, a linear support vector machine (SVM) is deployed with gender classification accuracy rates exceeding 95% on MORPH-II, competitive with benchmark results. A parallel computational approach is also proposed, attaining faster processing speeds and similar recognition rates on MORPH-II. Our computational approach can be applied to practical gender classification systems and generalized to other face analysis tasks, such as race classification and age prediction.","tags":null,"title":"A Comparison Study on Nonlinear Dimension Reduction Methods with Kernel Variations: Visualization, Optimization and Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Yip","Garrett Bingham","Katherine Kempfert","Jonathan Fabish","Troy Kling","Cuixian Chen","Yishi Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1544400000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544400000,"objectID":"ab48f0cc3edd73694c871136340e6c9f","permalink":"https://kkempfert.github.io/publication/preliminary/","publishdate":"2018-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/preliminary/","section":"publication","summary":"We perform preliminary studies on a large longitudinal face database MORPH-II, which is a benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition. First, we summarize the inconsistencies in the dataset and introduce the steps and strategy taken for cleaning. The potential implications of these inconsistencies on prior research are introduced. Next, we propose a new automatic subsetting scheme for evaluation protocol. It is intended to overcome the unbalanced racial and gender distributions of MORPH-II, while ensuring independence between training and testing sets. Finally, we contribute a novel global framework for age estimation that utilizes posterior probabilities from the race classification step to compute a racecomposite age estimate.
