Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and their kernel variants (KPCA, KLDA) are among the most popular DR methods. Recently, Supervised Kernel Principal Component Analysis (SKPCA) has been shown as another successful alternative. In this paper, brief reviews of these popular techniques are presented first. We then conduct a comparative performance study based on three simulated datasets, after which the performance of the techniques are evaluated through application to a pattern recognition problem in face image analysis. The gender classification problem is considered on MORPH-II and FG-NET, two popular longitudinal face aging databases. Several feature extraction methods are used, including biologically-inspired features (BIF), local binary patterns (LBP), histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and the Active Appearance Model (AAM). After applications of DR methods, a linear support vector machine (SVM) is deployed with gender classification accuracy rates exceeding 95% on MORPH-II, competitive with benchmark results. A parallel computational approach is also proposed, attaining faster processing speeds and similar recognition rates on MORPH-II. Our computational approach can be applied to practical gender classification systems and generalized to other face analysis tasks, such as race classification and age prediction.","tags":null,"title":"A Comparison Study on Nonlinear Dimension Reduction Methods with Kernel Variations: Visualization, Optimization and Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Katherine C.

Based on the content of music scores, this study identifies and quantifies distinctions between these string quartets using statistical and machine learning techniques. Our approach develops new musically meaningful summary features based on the sonata form structure. Several of these proposed summary features are found to be important for distinguishing between Haydn and Mozart string quartets. Leave-one-out classification accuracy rates exceed 85%, significantly higher than has been attained for this task in prior work. These results indicate there are identifiable, musically insightful differences between string quartets by Haydn versus Mozart, such as in their low accompanying voices, Cello and Viola. Our quantitative approaches can expand the longstanding dialogue surrounding Haydn and Mozart, offering empirical evidence of claims made by musicologists. Our proposed framework, which interweaves musical scholarship with learning algorithms, can be applied to other composer classification tasks and quantitative studies of classical music in general.","tags":null,"title":"Where Does Haydn End and Mozart Begin?

First, we summarize the inconsistencies in the dataset and introduce the steps and strategy taken for cleaning. The potential implications of these inconsistencies on prior research are introduced. Next, we propose a new automatic subsetting scheme for evaluation protocol. It is intended to overcome the unbalanced racial and gender distributions of MORPH-II, while ensuring independence between training and testing sets. Finally, we contribute a novel global framework for age estimation that utilizes posterior probabilities from the race classification step to compute a racecomposite age estimate. Preliminary experimental results on MORPH-II are presented.","tags":null,"title":"Preliminary Studies on a Large Face Database","type":"publication"}]
